- 'From/To': Select the start and desination node
- 'Search!': Press to start search
- 'Add node': Enter node number, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Add edge': Select start and end of edge to add, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Change Edge Weight': Select start and end of edge, and enter desired weight of edge, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Delete node': Select node to delete, press 'Ok!' to remove from graph
- 'Delete edge': Select start and end of desired edge, press 'Ok!' to remove from graph
- 'Reset Graph': Reset graph to original default graph
- 'Reset Colors': Reset the graph colors while retaining added nodes and edges
