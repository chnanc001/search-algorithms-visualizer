# Search Algorithm Visualizer

This project aims to visualize a handful of search algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

- [x] Depth First Search
- [x] Breadth First Search
- [x] Uniform-Cost Search

## Running locally

To run the application locally, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## How to use:
- 'Algorithm':          Select desired search algorithm
- 'From/To':            Select the start and desination node
- 'Search!':            Press to start search
- 'Add node':           Enter node number, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Add edge':           Select start and end of edge to add, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Change Edge Weight': Select start and end of edge, and enter desired weight of edge, press 'Ok!' to add to graph
- 'Delete node':        Select node to delete, press 'Ok!' to remove from graph
- 'Delete edge':        Select start and end of desired edge, press 'Ok!' to remove from graph
- 'Reset Graph':        Press to reset graph to original states
